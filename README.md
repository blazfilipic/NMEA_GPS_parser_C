# NMEA_GPS_parser_C

Code is part of the microcontroller project. 
" NMEA is an acronym for the National Marine Electronics Association. NMEA existed well before GPS was invented. According to the NMEA website, the association was formed in 1957 by a group of electronic dealers to create better communications with manufacturers. Today in the world of GPS, NMEA is a standard data format supported by all GPS manufacturers, much like ASCII is the standard for digital computer characters in the computer world."

Code parses and checks GPRMC (Recommended minimum specific GPS/Transit data) part of NMEA data buffer. 

It helps us to locate the device and we can also use this data for measuring speed of device.
